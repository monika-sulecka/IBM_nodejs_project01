>
> In this hands-on guided project, you will learn how to:
>
> - Develop both front end and back end with JavaScript
> - Style the front end using HTML and CSS
> - Use **npm**, the JavaScript package manager
>
> 💡 By the end of this guided project, you will have a **foundation for full-stack application development**.
